            <b>Petronas Twin Towers</b> were once the tallest buildings in the world. Now the world's tallest twin structures, the 88-storey buildings were designed by Cesar Pelli & Associates with both towers joined at the 41st and 42nd floors (175m above street level) by a 58 metre-long, double-decker Sky Bridge.
